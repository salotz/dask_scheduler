* Dask Jobqueue Scheduler Daemon

The dask jobqueue is an excellent interface to use dask with typical
HPCC job queueing systems like SLURM or PBS.

#+begin_center
NOTE: only supports SLURM at the moment. But others should be as well. Make a PR!
#+end_center

However, it doesn't provide an actual scheduling server that you can
connect to for launching jobs. This simple module provides this.

Just install:

#+begin_src bash
pip install 
#+end_src


Then from the cluster with the job queue system run this command (for
SLURM):

#+begin_src bash
dask_jobqueue_scheduler slurm
#+end_src

See ~dask_jobqueue_scheduler --help~ for all of the options.

This will start it with the default settings and should give you a URL
to use.

Then you just need to connect to it with a dask client to submit jobs:

#+begin_src python
  from dask.distributed import Client

  client = Client()

  def work_func(b):

      return 3 + b

  results = client.submit(work_func, [0,1,2,3]).result()
#+end_src
